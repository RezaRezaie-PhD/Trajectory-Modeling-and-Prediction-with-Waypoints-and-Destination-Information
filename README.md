# Trajectory-Modeling-and-Prediction-with-Waypoints-and-Destination-Information
For tracking and predicting the behavior of moving objects a mathematical model is presented to model trajectories with waypoints and destination information, where uncertainties are taken into account. The presented model is based on a class of stochastic processes called conditionally Markov (CM) processes.
